to create a program edit the scorpiac+ shell app
code your program in batch and make a command in the scorpiac shell
this command will tell the computer to run the program
for example if your program was blinkball you would type a command to run the program in the extension code after the ==
so one line of the first choice of scorpiac platform might say if %choicea%==runblinkball goto blinkball
then somewere in the shell app code it might say

:blinkball
cls
echo welcome to blinkball
pause

and so on
use this to make this programming languege with so many things huge 
the official relese of scorpiac+ build 1000 will be on march 20th 2020
this is the pre alpha scorpiac+ build 1000
bye
